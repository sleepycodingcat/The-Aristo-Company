                    silly little short film involving dinosaurs, ice cream, and spontaneous 
                    dancing, I've fallen heads over heels in love with filmmaking. Like all 
                    student filmmakers, I've donned the cap of every role in a film production, 
                    from directing to editing, or god forbid, attempting to act, but my main 
                    interest is in cinematography and editing.  </p>

                <p class="margin-top-10">There's a quote I love about being a creative because it's so true it stings:</p>
                <h2>In every creative pursuit, if your taste continually outpaces your skill, you know you're on the right path.</h2>
                <p class="margin-top-10">I've always held myself and my work up to frankly, ridiculous standards, 
                    but the great thing about that is that I never finish a project without learning in leaps and bounds, 
                    or sometimes, through tears and sweat. Even if I can't help cringing while watching my work (we all know that feeling...),
                     there's nothing to regret because I know I gave it my all.</p>

                <p class="margin-top-10">Cities have always been crucibles of innovation, where the density of human interaction catalyzes creativity and cultural evolution. Yet within these bustling environments, designers increasingly recognize the need for moments of pause—thoughtful spaces that allow for reflection and connection with nature. The juxtaposition of the runner against the green park beyond the window speaks to this essential balance: the human-made and the natural, movement and stillness, individual journeys within collective spaces. As urban populations continue to grow, with over 68% of humanity projected to live in cities by 2050, the thoughtful design of these environments becomes not just an aesthetic concern but a fundamental aspect of human wellbeing—creating spaces where people can thrive physically, socially, and psychologically.</p>
